# Motivation

content 
* 1.7 billion people were infected by Tuberculosis bacteria in 2018, which is around 23% of the world's population 
* TB still infects more than 10 million people each year and is the leading infectious disease killer
* Approximately 20% of TB cases around the world are resistant to anti-TB drugs, which is problematic because treatments are limited, often toxic, and expensive
* Out of the 10 million people who were sick with TB in 2018, around 3 million could not get proper care by their health systems
