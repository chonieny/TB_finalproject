## Project Motivation
According to CDC, TB infects more than 10 million people each year and is the leading infectious disease killer. In 2018, 1.7 billion people were infected by Tuberculosis bacteria, which is around 23% of the world's population. In addition, TB is becoming a more serious infectious disease as approximately 20% of TB cases around the world are resistant to anti-TB drugs. This is problematic because treatments for such MDR-TB(multi-drug resistant TB) and XDR-TB(extensively drug resistant TB) cases are limited, often toxic, and expensive. Thus, we wanted to learn more about TB cases around the world, especially focusing on Asian countries, and whether national fundings are related with TB mortality cases in these countries. Moreover, given the threat of drug resistant TB cases, we wanted to look more into treatment statuses for MDR-TB and XDR-TB patients.

## Data used
The source of our main datasets are from the World Health Organization. 
They can be accessed [here](https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/data).

## Website Navigation
* **Mortality & Funding**: Interactive world map of estimated number of deaths from TB(2000~2019), TB mortality rates and TB fundings in different Asian countries(2000~2019)
* **Funding Usages**: Graphs of top 5 funding usages in different Asian countries(2017~2019)
* **TB Hospitalization**: Graphs of treatment data for MDR-TB and XDR-TB patients in different Asian countries(2000~2019)
* **Regression Analysis**: Regression Analysis to predict the estimated average duration of hospital stay for MDR-TB and XDR-TB patients who are starting treatment 
* **Report**: Project report 

## Video Introduction

## Prediction
With regression analysis, we can predict the estimated average duration of stay if patients starting MDR-TB/XDR-TB treatment are hospitalized. We are 95% confident that the in 2020, the average duration of hospital stay for patients who started MDR-TB/XDR-TB treatment will fall between **-0.3268** and **5.75** days
