The main dataset for our project is made by  World Health Organization. It can be access at [here](https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/data). The dataset which consists types of usage funding has a range from 2017-2019, and other datset that consists estimated mortality of TB cases has a range of 2000 to 2019. To make the data consistent, we will use the data from 2017 to 2019.

Variables that we are going to use are:

* **rcvd_patsup**: Funding received for patient support (US Dollars)
* **rcvd_staff**: Funding received for National TB Programme staff (central unit staff and subnational TB staff)  (US Dollars)
* **rcvd_mdrmgt**:Funding received for programme costs to treat drug-resistant TB (US Dollars)
* **rcvd_fld**:Funding received for drugs to treat drug-susceptible TB (US Dollars)
* **rcvd_oth**:Funding received for all other budget line items (US Dollars)

* **e_mort_num**: Estimated number of deaths from TB (all forms)
* **e_pop_num**: Estimated total population number


To be more accurate, we will make a new variable called **e_mort_pro_100k**, a proportion of estimated proportion of death from TB by dividing  the estimated number of deaths from TB(**e_mort_num**) by estimated total population number(**e_pop_num**) and multiply by 100,000.

There are other types of usage funding, but we selected top 5 by taking the mean of each types and ordered them.

# Transformation and Assumption of the Normality 

Below is the density graph of proportion of the estimated mortality of TB per 100k.
Since the graph is right-skewed, we need to make some changes to make this to satisfy the assumptions of the linear model.
```{r regression anlaysis, include=FALSE, warning=FALSE }
TB_burden = read.csv("./data/TB_burden_countries.csv")

TB_burden = TB_burden %>%
  mutate(
    e_mort_pro = as.numeric(e_mort_num)/as.numeric(e_pop_num),
    e_mort_pro_100k = as.numeric(e_mort_num)/as.numeric(e_pop_num) * 100000
  )

TB_burden %>%
  filter(year == 2017 |year == 2018 | year == 2019) %>%
  filter(country == "Bangladesh" | country == "Cambodia" |country == "India"| country ==  "Indonesia" | country == "Lao People's Democratic Republic"|country ==  "Mongolia"| country == "Myanmar" | country == "Nepal"|country == "Solomon Islands"|country == "Thailand"|country == "Timor-Leste" ) 

```

```{r GGPLOT, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
TB_burden %>%
  filter(year == 2017 |year == 2018 | year == 2019) %>%
  filter(country == "Bangladesh" | country == "Cambodia" |country == "India"| country ==  "Indonesia" | country == "Lao People's Democratic Republic"|country ==  "Mongolia"| country == "Myanmar" | country == "Nepal"|country == "Solomon Islands"|country == "Thailand"|country == "Timor-Leste" ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = e_mort_pro_100k)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), colour = "black", fill = "white") +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.3, fill = "red") +
  labs(x = "Estimated mortality of TB cases per 100K", title = "Histogram of Estimated mortality of TB cases Per 100K")
```

We used log transformation to make the graph normal. Below is the graph after the transformation, and we can say that it is more bell-shaped than the previous graph.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
TB_burden %>%
  filter(year == 2017 |year == 2018 | year == 2019) %>%
  filter(country == "Bangladesh" | country == "Cambodia" |country == "India"| country ==  "Indonesia" | country == "Lao People's Democratic Republic"|country ==  "Mongolia"| country == "Myanmar" | country == "Nepal"|country == "Solomon Islands"|country == "Thailand"|country == "Timor-Leste" ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = e_mort_pro_100k)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), colour = "black", fill = "white") +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.3, fill = "red") +
  labs(x = "Estimated mortality of TB cases per 100K", title = "Histogram of Estimated mortality of TB cases Per 100K") +
  scale_x_log10()
```

# Results
With the regression analysis, we can predict the Estimated average duration of stay if patients starting MDR-TB/XDR-TB treatment are hospitalized. We will use the top 5 usage of funding and year. 
We have included the interaction between **rcvd_patsup** and **rcvd_staff** because there could be a possible relationship that the funding for patient support can have different duration of stay to different national TB Programme staff who received funding.

```{r include=FALSE}
df1 = TB_burden %>% 
  select(year, e_inc_num, e_pop_num, e_mort_pro_100k, e_mort_pro )

df2 = TB_usage %>%
  select(year, hospd_mdr_dur, rcvd_patsup,  rcvd_staff,  rcvd_mdrmgt, rcvd_fld, rcvd_oth, rcvd_patsup, rcvd_prog, rcvd_sld, rcvd_staff, rcvd_tbhiv )
  
TB_regression = merge(df1, df2, by=c("year")) %>%
  na.omit()

lm_model = lm(hospd_mdr_dur ~ year + rcvd_patsup + rcvd_staff + rcvd_mdrmgt + rcvd_fld + rcvd_oth + rcvd_patsup*rcvd_staff, data = TB_regression)
```

Based on transformation above, the model we are going to fit is:
$$log(average\ duration\ of\ stay\ for\ treatment) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 year + \beta_2 patient  + \beta_3 staff + \beta_4 programme + \beta_5 drugs + \beta_6 other + \beta_7 patient*staff$$

```{r}
summary(lm_model)
```

Based on the summary, we can see that some of our main effects and the interaction term are statistically significant. 

The F-statistics is 2221.3144029. Itâ€™s obvious that the model is statistically significant under any reasonable critical value. It also has a R2
 value of 0.5108901, which indicated chosen variables together are able to explain 51.09%
 of observed variation.
